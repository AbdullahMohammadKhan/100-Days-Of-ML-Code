# 100DaysOfMLCode
The creation of this repository was inspired by [Siraj Raval's challenge](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6420525903968825344/) to code machine learning for at least an hour everyday for 100 days.
I nervously accepted this challenge in addition to working full time in the 2018 summer semester. I will use this repository to store code, jupyter notebook examples, and thought processes.
